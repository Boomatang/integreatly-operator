# I07 - Overview of Red Hat OpenShift API Management

## Description

Concept module for a new RHOAM service user. Describes the workflow, briefly defines important terms, says which part of the user interface you use to perform a particular procedure, distinguishes different types of RHOAM users, and provide a link to the 3scale or SSO documentation that provides the detailed instructions for performing the procedure.

## Steps

1. Read the preview here: https://pantheon.corp.redhat.com/pantheon/preview/latest/65ed2b0e-4905-4515-97e1-3fcd41873d1a
2. Check the organization, order and completeness of the workflow.
3. Check whether important terms are accurately and sufficiently defined.
4. Check whether the overview correctly identifies the location in the user interface where the user performs a particular procedure.
5. Check whether the overview clearly identifies the user type who performs the procedure.
6. Check whether the link to detailed instructions works correctly and provides information that is correct for the RHOAM user.
7. Identify caveats that need to be added to the overview in the case that the linked-to-instructions contain information that is not correct for the RHOAM user.
